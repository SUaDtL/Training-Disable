This is my first run at making any of my scripting public, so if I've done someting wrong/weird, feel free to let me know.

This is a relatively straightforward script that I wrote to automatically disable user accounts of people who are delinquent on their required training by directly checking the SQL database that houses training status.

Anyone is more than welcome to use all or a part of my scripts if they believe it will help their organization be more efficient and I'll attempt to answer any questions people might have.

I will very likely NOT be implementing requested changes FOR people.  I wrote this for use in my own environment, and I'm making it available for anyone to modify for personal/professional use however they want to, but I'm not super interested in doing their work for them.

In the future I will likely upload some other projects that I actively maintain, and will take requests on those, but this is informational only.
